This is a simple and widely used representation learning algorithm. It is an
un-supervised learning method; there is no labels or target variables.It groups
the dataset based on the pattern in the data.It is used in various
recommendation engines (Spotify helping you find new songs based on the type of
songs you listen, YouTube recommends you the next video to watch, Amazon suggest
the product you might be interested to buy), customer segmentation, image
segmentation etc.
