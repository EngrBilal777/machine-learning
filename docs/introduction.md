### Introduction to machine learning

There are certain type of problems we face in everyday life that cannot be
solved by definitive algorithm, e.g., object recognition, predicting financial
markets etc. In such cases, we collect a set of input and output samples (called
training set); and based on the trends on those data, we try to predict future
outcomes.

We will see there are two broad category of machine learning problems: (1)
supervised and (2) unsupervised learning. As the names suggest in the former
case, we have data available to train our model.

Supervised machine learning problems has two categories (a) classification and
(b) regression. In case of classification, we have discrete targets/labels (
e.g., whether an email is real or spam, whether the image is of a cat or dog),
while in case of regression, we need to predict a quantitative value (e.g.,
predicting second hand car price based on a set of features like brand, color,
mileage driven, engine size etc.).
